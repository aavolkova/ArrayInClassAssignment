Array In Class Assignment. We need to modify the code, add sorting the array.
What You Should See

before: 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 50
after    : 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 50

After you add in the code you're supposed to, you should see something more like this:

before: 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 50
after    : 12 32 39 44 45 50 75 86 87 93


What You Should Do on Your Own

Assignments turned in without these things will receive no credit.

Use nested loops, an if statement, and some "swapping" code to rearrange the values in the array 
so that they're in order from smallest to largest
